# Story Showrunner Validation Workspace — REVIEWER HANDOFF

Date: 2026-09-23  
Status: `CURRENT TRUTH ONLY / G6A IN_PROGRESS / GPT-SOVITS API SMOKE PASS_CANDIDATE / OWNER LISTEN ACCEPTED / MATERIAL TIMING RECORD-EXACT / MIGRATION NOT YET CANONICAL`

Historical chronology belongs in:
- `PROJECT_RECORD.md`
- `EXECUTION_EVIDENCE.md`
- `experiments/`

Current documentation map:
- `docs/CURRENT_DOC_INDEX.md`

## 1. Final goal

Validate and promote the reusable:

`entropy-student/spike.skill/story-showrunner`

The current `ai-story-showrunner` repository remains the validation/runtime workspace.

Promotion rule remains:

```text
Candidate contracts
→ current episode final-video E2E
→ final QA
→ story-showrunner CANONICAL
```

## 2. Accepted pipeline

```text
TopicProvider
→ DomainAdapter
→ Knowledge / CausalCore
→ StoryEngine
→ Writer
→ TimingCompiler
→ Director
→ Frame / AssetCompiler
→ ProductionCompiler
→ ExecutorAdapter
→ QA
```

AI is the first Domain Adapter, not the core boundary.

## 3. Gate truth after 2026-09-23 takeover review

```text
P0 / G1 / G2 / G2.5 / G3 / G3R / G4 / G5
= ACCEPTED WITH THEIR ORIGINAL VALIDATION SCOPE

G6R = PASS
G6A First-E2E Asset Calibration Gate = IN_PROGRESS / AUDIO_QA_RETURN / FRAME_ASSETS_PARTIAL
G7 Final End-to-End Validation = BLOCKED_BY_G6A
```

Important interpretation:

- G2/G3/G4/G5 PASS means their declared contract/quality gates passed.
- It does **not** mean production throughput or full Candidate E2E already passed.
- Do not reopen accepted story/director/asset semantics unless a new failure invalidates them.

## 4. Why G6R exists

The takeover review found a post-extraction seam:

1. Candidate Timing Compiler already produced 44 Speech Units, Production SRT and TTS Manifest.
2. The current G6 package still consumed the older G4 Visual Beat artifact whose `timing_source` is `JINGSUI_PRIOR_ESTIMATE`.
3. Candidate runtime rules now require planned/final timing semantics and durable Speech Unit anchors.
4. The Runtime Timeline Resolver contract described those anchors, but the current Visual Beat schema/package did not encode them as a required executable contract.

Therefore the existing G6 package v1 is retained as historical evidence but is **not current Candidate E2E proof**.

## 5. Preserved truth — do not redo

G6R must not redesign:

- locked Blind Search script;
- KnowledgeCore / Story meaning;
- the 44 accepted Visual Beat meanings;
- Visual Beat order;
- accepted POV decisions;
- G5 Frame Blueprint creative intent;
- character identity/style rules;
- Voice Timing Profile v2.1;
- FFmpeg baseline renderer decision.

This is a runtime-contract reconciliation, not a creative rebaseline.

## 6. G6R current artifacts

Timing already compiled:

- 44 Speech Units;
- 43 voiced TTS rows;
- 1 explicit 1.4s silent HARD_ANCHOR;
- planned total: 146.7209s;
- exact locked-script coverage: PASS.

New reconciliation binding:

`experiments/g6/blind-search-answer/timing/05_VISUAL_BEAT_TIMING_BINDINGS.json`

It provides 44/44:

```text
visual_beat_id
↔ speech_unit_id
+ START anchor
+ WINDOW_END anchor
+ timing_flex / lock class
```

Historical absolute G4 timestamps are planning evidence only.

## 7. Runtime resolver truth

The Candidate resolver must:

- treat real normalized TTS duration as final speech-clock truth;
- preserve text/order/semantic pace/authored pauses;
- resolve final absolute timestamps from durable anchors;
- emit FINAL_SUBTITLES / FINAL_TIMELINE / FINAL_SHOT_TIMELINE;
- treat profile drift as diagnostic unless a locked hard constraint becomes infeasible;
- never require an ordinary Owner round-trip for retiming.

A deterministic reference implementation and schema alignment belong to the Candidate Skill repository and are part of G6R.

## 8. FFmpeg truth

Video runtime probe already passed programmatically.

Baseline first E2E renderer:

`FFmpeg / deterministic still-first assembly`

Remotion / Hyperframe are optional later renderers, not baseline blockers.

The earlier Handoff statement saying the renderer probe was still pending is superseded.

## 9. Production package truth

`production-package-v1` remains historical candidate evidence.

Current execution package:

`experiments/g6/blind-search-answer/production-package-v2`

It is rebuilt against:
- Candidate planned timing;
- durable 44/44 Visual Beat anchors;
- Candidate-compliant Visual Beats;
- executable Runtime Timeline Resolver;
- current Candidate schemas.

Package v1 remains historical evidence only.

## 10. G6R acceptance

G6R may PASS only when:

- [x] 44/44 Speech Unit ↔ Visual Beat binding exists;
- [x] no missing/duplicate Visual Beat IDs in the validation fixture;
- [x] planned binding total remains 146.7209s;
- [x] Candidate Visual Beat schema requires durable anchors;
- [x] deterministic Timeline Resolver reference implementation exists;
- [x] resolver smoke test passes without creative mutation;
- [x] Candidate Skill status docs are synchronized;
- [x] current execution package is rebuilt from reconciled contracts.

Reviewer result:

`PASS_G6R_CANDIDATE_RUNTIME_RECONCILIATION`

## 11. Owner intervention

`OWNER_ACTION_REQUIRED = NO`

Normal technical reconciliation remains Reviewer/maintainer work.

## 12. Immediate next action

G6A has now been partially executed.

Current facts:

- real CosyVoice production TTS executed;
- Runtime Timeline Resolver executed against real durations;
- runtime master duration is approximately 143.0936s;
- Owner listening QA returned the master for breathing-gap, cut-tail, pronunciation, articulation and prosody issues;
- a targeted CosyVoice repair candidate exists but is not yet accepted;
- first production-frame snapshot reached 20 / 44;
- final render remains blocked.

A local GPT-SoVITS candidate trial is now active because the remaining complaint is not only timing/joins but also synthetic timbre, voiced noise and weak emotion.

Local environment read-back now confirms:
- GPT-SoVITS workspace and dedicated Conda Python resolve correctly;
- Python user-site isolation is active;
- CUDA / RTX 4050 are available;
- required WebUI imports pass;
- `zh_CN` locale is available;
- the WebUI has opened successfully on the Owner machine;
- `pip check` still reports a non-blocking package-name mismatch for `faster-whisper → onnxruntime` while `onnxruntime-gpu` imports successfully.

Local GPT-SoVITS fine-tune status on 2026-09-23:

- target experiment: `narrator01_v2pp`, model family `v2ProPlus`;
- training source prepared from the Owner-selected clean voice sample and produced 13 aligned segments;
- the first fine-tune attempts exposed several Windows-specific runtime failures that the WebUI incorrectly surfaced as "training completed";
- `7-sv_cn` was initially empty because the SV extractor used `torchaudio.load()` and hit the same TorchCodec path previously seen in inference; the local extractor was patched to load WAV through librosa and 13 SV embeddings were then produced;
- SoVITS on Windows single RTX 4050 crashed at the first batch through `mp.spawn + Gloo + DDP` with exit code `3221225477 / 0xC0000005`; the local `s2_train.py` path was patched to bypass DDP for single-GPU Windows execution;
- GPT training had the same unnecessary single-GPU distributed path; `s1_train.py` was patched to use `devices=1 / strategy=auto` for one GPU, and `AR/data/bucket_sampler.py` was patched to use `num_replicas=1 / rank=0` when torch.distributed is not initialized;
- PyTorch Lightning Rich teardown then raised a Windows GBK encoding error after a successful epoch; the local GPT training path now disables the Rich progress bar;
- final SoVITS weights now exist at epochs 4 and 8, with `narrator01_v2pp_e8_s248.pth` as the latest trained SoVITS candidate;
- final GPT weights now exist at epochs 5, 10 and 15, with `narrator01_v2pp-e15.ckpt` as the latest trained GPT candidate;
- the earlier zero-shot listening test used a different target-speaker reference than the voice used for `narrator01_v2pp` fine-tuning, so that earlier listening result is retained only as functional zero-shot evidence and is NOT a valid speaker-similarity A/B baseline for the fine-tuned narrator;
- the fair speaker-similarity comparison must use the same narrator voice reference (preferably a clean held-out 3–10s clip), same target sentence and same inference settings for both base/zero-shot and fine-tuned conditions;
- this establishes local fine-tune execution PASS only; voice similarity / naturalness is not yet accepted and no canonical TTS migration has occurred;
- first post-finetune inference check found `narrator01_v2pp-e15.ckpt` produced an abnormal/near-empty result with the same SoVITS e8 model and reference conditions;
- `narrator01_v2pp-e10.ckpt + SoVITS e8` could sound good on individual runs, but repeated testing exposed semantic-generation instability: one run duplicated the phrase "我才意识到", and subsequent runs could collapse into sparse/non-speech output;
- reducing `temperature` from 1.0 to 0.8 did not make e10 sufficiently stable;
- switching only the GPT checkpoint to `narrator01_v2pp-e5.ckpt`, while keeping SoVITS e8, the same reference audio/text, target text, speed 1, top_k 15, top_p 1 and temperature 0.8, produced 3/3 successful generations;
- current GPT-SoVITS QA candidate is therefore `narrator01_v2pp-e5.ckpt + narrator01_v2pp_e8_s248.pth` with `temperature=0.8`; e10 and e15 are rejected from the current candidate path for stability;
- follow-up repeated QA on the curiosity/suspicion sentence produced 3/3 successful generations with speaker timbre judged similar to the target voice, but the three runs had noticeably different prosody/intonation;
- enabling the WebUI option `是否直接对上次合成结果调整语速和音色，防止随机性` for the same sentence produced 3/3 perceptually identical outputs;
- therefore same-text deterministic replay is available through the inference cache/freeze path; this control is suitable for reusing an accepted semantic/prosody realization, but it must be cleared when moving to a new sentence so a new semantic realization can be generated;
- current interpretation: speaker-similarity, basic generation stability and same-text replay determinism are promising; cross-sentence prosody control is still not yet validated;
- follow-up reversal/surprise sentence QA with cache/freeze disabled was judged by Owner as having no material problem, with no reported repetition/collapse or obvious delivery defect;
- short-reaction QA using the target text `……等等，这也能算正常？` failed on the first attempt; this case is not accepted yet and is being treated as a short-utterance / punctuation robustness probe rather than a reason to reject the whole candidate;
- removing only the leading ellipsis in synthesis text (`等等，这也能算正常？`) produced a successful generation, which supports a synthesis-text normalization rule that strips leading ellipsis while preserving the display/subtitle text;
- the successful short reaction still had a slightly overlong internal pause, so punctuation/short-utterance pause shaping remains a minor QA issue rather than a generation failure;
- removing the internal comma entirely (`等等这也能算正常？`) eliminated the pause altogether, confirming the desired delivery sits between the current comma realization (too long) and no-punctuation realization (too short/no pause);
- replacing that comma with a Chinese enumeration comma (`等等、这也能算正常？`) caused synthesis failure, so `、` is rejected as a pause-control token for this short-reaction pattern;
- Owner decision: do not introduce systematic per-comma pause insertion or other post-processing because the engineering overhead is too high for the intended production workflow;
- default synthesis punctuation remains the ordinary Chinese comma `，`; occasional slightly long comma pauses are accepted as a minor quality tradeoff unless they become a persistent QA failure pattern;
- final representative serious-closing QA sentence was judged by Owner as having no material problem;
- representative manual listening QA now covers neutral narration, curiosity/suspicion, reversal/surprise, short reaction (with known punctuation caveat), and serious closing; current GPT-SoVITS candidate remains `narrator01_v2pp-e5.ckpt + narrator01_v2pp_e8_s248.pth`, `temperature=0.8`, `top_k=15`, `top_p=1`, speed 1;
- manual candidate listening QA is sufficient to move to Voice Timing Profile calibration and automation integration; canonical promotion still requires runtime/adapter validation rather than further ad-hoc sentence tuning.
- this strengthens the current `e5 + e8` candidate, but broader cross-sentence delivery coverage is still pending before canonical promotion;
- this is still a candidate-quality result, not canonical promotion.

### Asset-generation timing policy — Owner decision

Current phase is still **asset generation / calibration**, not final edit lock.

For this phase:
- do **not** force GPT-SoVITS speech to hit an exact planned duration;
- do **not** time-stretch or compress voiced speech merely to match the planned SRT;
- every generated Speech Unit must record its **actual measured duration precisely**;
- the runtime timeline must be derived from those recorded durations;
- occasional long internal breath/pause remains a known quality issue but is not repaired during material generation unless it becomes a synthesis failure;
- after the first video assembly, create a third/final timing pass that may trim redundant breath gaps / overlong non-semantic pauses and then regenerate the final subtitle/timeline timestamps.

Working three-layer interpretation:

```text
SRT1 = planned / compiler timing
SRT2 = actual generated-audio timing, measured precisely; current material-generation authority
SRT3 = post-assembly final timing after breath-gap cleanup; final delivery authority
```

Important:
SRT2 does **not** need to match SRT1 precisely. The recording of SRT2 durations **does** need to be precise.

Current technical next action:

```text
manual GPT-SoVITS representative listening QA = PASS_CANDIDATE
→ validate official API path with e5 + e8 and fixed-seed deterministic smoke
→ accept/reject the API realization by one retained listening sample
→ if PASS, run one-time GPT-SoVITS Voice Timing Profile calibration + held-out validation
→ build provider adapter/runtime validation
→ only then decide whether GPT-SoVITS replaces the canonical CosyVoice audio baseline
→ regenerate only required episode units and resolve runtime timeline again
→ only then resume the remaining frame/final-render gate
```

Prepared automation helpers:

- `tools/gpt-sovits/PATCH_API_TORCHCODEC.bat`
- `tools/gpt-sovits/START_GPT_SOVITS_API.bat`
- `tools/gpt-sovits/RUN_API_DETERMINISM_SMOKE.bat`

The API smoke deliberately uses a fixed seed to test production reproducibility. That seed is only a candidate setting until the retained output passes Owner listening QA.

Current audio-trial handoff:

`docs/G6A_AUDIO_QA_AND_TTS_MIGRATION_TRIAL.md`

CosyVoice remains the current canonical timing/voice baseline until the A/B trial passes. Do not mutate the portable Skill merely because the candidate is installed.

Do not promote the Skill to CANONICAL until final-video E2E PASS.


## Topic Supply v0.2 — 2026-09-27

Owner accepted the Topic Supply rebaseline after direct GitHub review.

Decision:
- preserve the existing HOT / EVERGREEN, Human Relevance, Mechanism Integrity, One Mechanism, Storyability, Controlling Question, Idea vs Counter-Idea and climax-proves-meaning contracts;
- change the default discovery entry from `AI Signal / AI Problem → Audience Translation` to `Human-interest X → Observed Paradox → WHY → Human Tension → AI Changed Process → Mechanism`;
- retain the old AI-first path as a valid compatibility/fallback route for strong AI signals and explicit Owner AI topics;
- do not retroactively rewrite existing Topic Registry, Calendar, Daily snapshots or validation episodes;
- add v0.2 TopicOpportunity / Registry fields as backward-compatible optional fields;
- no change to current G6A production execution, audio, visual or timing gates.

Canonical topic docs:
- `docs/TOPIC_OPERATING_SYSTEM.md` v0.2;
- `docs/CONTENT_STRATEGY_AND_CONVERSION.md`;
- `docs/PIPELINE_AND_GATES.md`;
- `docs/DAILY_TOPIC_AUTOMATION_V2.md` v0.2.1.

Rollback protection:
- pre-change main SHA: `16e2c86039a26175f99204239c19c1bdf35f4a10`;
- rollback branch: `rollback/ai-story-showrunner-topic-os-v01-20260927`;
- implementation branch: `codex/ai-story-showrunner-topic-os-v02`.

Reviewer assessment:
`PASS_TOPIC_SUPPLY_V0_2_CONTRACT / G6A_UNCHANGED`.


## Topic Supply v0.2.1 — Human Process + Meaning Dedup — 2026-09-27

Owner accepted the second Topic Supply patch after two stress tests.

Problem found in v0.2:
- one X domain can contain many real topic families, so `x_domain` alone is too coarse;
- different X domains can hide the same semantic thesis/tension and bypass topic/angle dedup.

Accepted additions:
- `human_process_family` — what the human is actually doing;
- `meaning_fingerprint` — normalized `human_tension + controlling_question` key used for semantic dedup, not a locked thesis;
- `D5 Meaning Duplicate` — cross-domain duplicate gate.

Validation:
- single-domain Food decomposition showed many different Human Process families;
- cross-domain test: 5 domains × 10 candidates = 50 raw candidates;
- first semantic pass produced 43 coarse Meaning fingerprints;
- clear collisions were detected across food/personality/entertainment, cooking/work/gaming, meal/dating/work planning, and relationship/work writing;
- five deliberately different Meaning families were expanded into Story Premises and remained distinct.

Preserved:
- HOT / EVERGREEN;
- AI-first compatibility route;
- Controlling Question First;
- Idea vs Counter-Idea;
- Climax proves meaning;
- existing Calendar / Registry / Daily snapshots;
- current G6A production line.

Evidence:
`docs/TOPIC_OS_V021_MEANING_DEDUP_VALIDATION.md`.

Rollback:
- v0.2 snapshot branch: `rollback/ai-story-showrunner-topic-os-v02-before-meaning-20260927`;
- base SHA: `080b3cea54e640c75d7f11b265c8fa6397661192`.

Reviewer decision:
`PASS_TOPIC_SUPPLY_V0_2_1_MEANING_DEDUP / G6A_UNCHANGED`.


## Topic System Full Sync Audit — 2026-09-27

Owner requested a complete re-check of Topic selection, Topic Bank, Daily periodic update and all related paths after Topic OS v0.2.1.

Drift found:
- Evergreen Bank remained AI-first;
- project Topic Worker contract still emitted old fields;
- Worker Adapter plan had stale Topic Worker state;
- live scheduled task `AI选题雷达` still used AI-only discovery + D1–D4;
- portable `story-showrunner` AI Topic Provider / pipeline still used v0.1 AI-first logic.

Corrections:
- Evergreen Bank upgraded to Human-world-first + preserved AI mechanism reserve;
- Topic Worker contract synchronized to Human Process / Meaning / D1–D5;
- actual scheduled task updated in place, no duplicate task created;
- portable Candidate Topic layer synchronized on its own guarded branch;
- historical Daily snapshots / Registry / Calendar entries intentionally preserved.

Special note:
`topic-ledger/daily/2026-09-27.json` is the last known pre-sync scheduled-task run. It remains historical evidence and must not be presented as Topic OS v0.2.1 execution proof.

Audit:
`docs/TOPIC_SYSTEM_FULL_SYNC_AUDIT_20260927.md`.

Reviewer result:
`PASS_TOPIC_SYSTEM_CONFIG_SYNC / RUNTIME_PROOF_PENDING_NEXT_DAILY_RUN / G6A_UNCHANGED`.

Portable Candidate topic sync is confirmed on `entropy-student/spike.skill/main@2796982ed9447ea0283253762ea59cf604566ccb`. The live scheduled task is updated, but the next real Daily Radar artifact is still required as runtime proof.


## Topic Runtime Proof v0.2.1 — 2026-09-27

A manual real-signal Daily Radar validation was executed after the full-sync.

Artifact:
`topic-ledger/daily/2026-09-27-v021-runtime-proof.json`

Result:
`PASS_MANUAL_RUNTIME_TOPIC_OS_V0_2_1`

Key proof:
- Human-world-first generation executed;
- Human Process + Meaning fields populated;
- D1–D5 executed;
- D5 blocked a current Shopping-Agent HOT candidate because it collapsed to existing `DELEGATION_VS_CONTROL`;
- insufficient-evidence candidates returned HOLD instead of being forced through;
- best clean validation candidate: Learning / `SKILL_LEARNING` / `GUIDANCE_VS_SKILL_FORMATION`.

No Calendar/Registry mutation was performed in proof mode.

Current evidence boundary:
`CONFIG_SYNC_PASS / MANUAL_RUNTIME_PASS / SCHEDULED_TRIGGER_PROOF_PENDING / G6A_UNCHANGED`.


## GPT-SoVITS SRT1 → SRT2 Batch Helper — 2026-09-28

Owner approved adding a reusable material-stage batch helper so an Executor Agent can take a locked planned SRT directly to GPT-SoVITS audio + SRT2.

Added:
- `tools/gpt-sovits/GPT_SOVITS_SRT_BATCH_EXECUTOR.py`
- `tools/gpt-sovits/RUN_GPT_SOVITS_SRT_BATCH.bat`
- `tools/gpt-sovits/SRT_BATCH_EXECUTOR.md`
- `tools/gpt-sovits/SYNTHESIS_MAP_EXAMPLE.json`
- `tools/gpt-sovits/EXECUTOR_AGENT_TASK.md`

Contract:
```text
SRT1 planned
→ one SRT cue = one material-stage TTS unit
→ GPT-SoVITS API
→ unit WAVs
→ exact actual durations
→ SRT2_ACTUAL.srt
→ narration_master.wav
→ execution report
```

Important boundaries:
- display/subtitle text is locked;
- synthesis-only rewriting is explicit via map, never silent;
- no time-stretch/compression to force SRT1 duration;
- matching PASS units are resume-safe;
- one technical retry by default, no aesthetic retry loop;
- SRT2 is material-stage timing, not final SRT3;
- this helper does not replace the richer Speech Unit + TTS Manifest + Runtime Timeline Resolver path when that package exists.

Evidence state:
`STATIC_INTEGRATION_READY / LOCAL_FULL_EPISODE_RUNTIME_PENDING`.

Do not claim local Windows/API execution PASS until the helper is run against a real episode.
