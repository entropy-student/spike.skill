## Gate: P0-GOVERNANCE-RECONCILIATION

- Date: 2026-09-20
- Purpose: 将已经建立的 AI Story Showrunner 项目重新对齐 canonical Governance，并通过 fresh authoritative read-back 核验当前仓库事实。
- Historical note: 项目最初 README / PROJECT_RECORD / docs 写入发生在正式 `REVIEWER_HANDOFF.md` 建立之前。本轮不伪造历史 Executor 证据，而是对当前事实重新核验。

### Preflight Evidence

Canonical Governance read:

- Repository: `entropy-student/spike.skill`
- Path: `vps-project-governance/SKILL.md`
- Core baseline: v0.1.6
- Governance Handoff reviewed: YES
- Relevant conclusion: Owner / Reviewer / Executor、Gate、Evidence、PASS/RETURN、唯一 Reviewer Handoff 均应保留；VPS-only addenda 可在当前非部署阶段标 N/A。

Project authoritative read-back reviewed:

- `ai-story-showrunner/README.md`
- `ai-story-showrunner/PROJECT_RECORD.md`
- `ai-story-showrunner/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `ai-story-showrunner/docs/PIPELINE_AND_GATES.md`
- `ai-story-showrunner/docs/WORKER_CONTRACTS.md`
- `ai-story-showrunner/docs/TOOL_INVENTORY.md`

### Findings Before Reconciliation

PASS-like strengths:

- 已有明确 Gate；
- 已有 nearest-gate rollback；
- 已区分 Showrunner / Worker；
- 已记录 UNKNOWN；
- 已禁止假自动化和 Provider lock-in。

Governance gaps:

1. 缺唯一 `REVIEWER_HANDOFF.md`；
2. `PROJECT_RECORD.md` 被写成“长期单一真相”，与 canonical Governance 的 current Reviewer truth 模型不完全一致；
3. 没有独立记录 bootstrap reconciliation evidence；
4. 没有明确说明哪些 VPS-only 条款 N/A、何时恢复；
5. 没有 machine-readable current status 镜像。

### Actual Writes

本轮新增：

- `REVIEWER_HANDOFF.md`
- `docs/GOVERNANCE_ADAPTATION.md`
- `EXECUTION_EVIDENCE.md`
- `CURRENT_STATUS.json`

本轮修改：

- `README.md`
- `PROJECT_RECORD.md`

### Verification

需要满足：

- Reviewer Handoff 能单独回答：目标、当前 Gate、已 PASS、UNKNOWN、下一步、Owner 是否需要介入；
- PROJECT_RECORD 不再与 Reviewer Handoff 竞争“当前唯一真相”；
- README 阅读顺序优先恢复 Reviewer Handoff；
- CURRENT_STATUS.json 与 Reviewer Handoff 的 current gate 一致；
- G1 保持 CURRENT / IN_PROGRESS，不因治理文档补齐而误判 PASS。

### Result

```text
PASS_CANDIDATE_P0_GOVERNANCE_RECONCILIATION
STOP_AT_REVIEWER: YES
```

Reviewer accepted decision: `PASS`，记录于 `REVIEWER_HANDOFF.md`。

## G1 Design Decision — Low-Level Antigravity Execution

- Date: 2026-09-20
- Owner decision: Antigravity should act like the previous Execution Agent and complete image generation + timeline assembly in one run, with near-zero creative freedom.
- Production simplification: final video is primarily a sequence of generated still images placed at exact times; complex motion should normally be decomposed into more still-image shots.
- Cost assumption supplied by Owner: Nano Banana image generation is cheap enough that image count is not the primary optimization target.
- Audio path remains OPEN: upstream TTS vs Antigravity TTS from locked script/SRT.

### Accepted design changes

- Added `docs/LOW_LEVEL_EXECUTION_PACKAGE.md`.
- Frozen one-small-shot ≈ one-image default.
- Frozen Character / Scene / Style canonical-reference contracts.
- Frozen exact Shot Timeline + one-row-per-image generation sheet.
- Frozen `DO_NOT_ADD` default for unspecified effects.
- Antigravity cannot change story, text, shot count, timing, prompts, characters, scenes or edit style.

### Result

## Gate G1 — Worker Inventory + Canonical Contracts

- Date: 2026-09-20
- Reviewer decision: PASS

### Read-back Evidence

Confirmed present and readable:

- `docs/CONTENT_STRATEGY_AND_CONVERSION.md`
- `docs/WORKER_ADAPTER_PLAN.md`
- `docs/ADAPTER_FIELD_MAPPINGS.md`
- `docs/LOW_LEVEL_EXECUTION_PACKAGE.md`
- `docs/ANTIGRAVITY_POC.md`
- `schemas/topic_opportunity.schema.json`
- `schemas/episode.schema.json`
- `schemas/shot.schema.json`

### Worker Findings

- No canonical standalone Topic Skill found in current `spike.skill` root + recursive path scan.
- No canonical standalone McKee Skill found in current scan.
- Jingsui is admitted only as a candidate Writer Style Engine behind a restrictive Adapter.
- acquisition-growth-radar is positioned at Publish/Learning, not Topic selection.
- entertainment-rander is optional Signal Intake only.
- Antigravity integration classification: `MANUAL_EXECUTOR / NOT_YET_POC_VALIDATED`.

### Accepted Design

- Topic contract uses hard gates before comparative scoring.
- Every episode has one primary content job: DISCOVERY / TRUST / SOLUTION.
- Metrics are separated into Traffic / Trust / Conversion.
- Visual Repetition Gate is required.
- One video defaults to one core AI mechanism.
- McKee-style causal structure belongs to internal Story Engine Gate for now.

## Owner Review Hold After G1

- Date: 2026-09-20
- Owner instruction: stop after G1 completion and review the overall direction before continuing.
- Authoritative state: `G1 PASS / HOLD BEFORE G2`.
- A MCP G2 preflight draft had already been created before the stop instruction was processed.
- That MCP material is retained for traceability but explicitly downgraded to `DRAFT_HOLD_NOT_ACCEPTED`; it is **not** counted as G2 progress or evidence.
- No Agent / Memory G2 validation was performed.
- No G3+ work is accepted.

### Result

```text
G1 PASS

## Gate G2.5 — Topic Supply / Ledger / Dedup

- Date: 2026-09-20
- Status: PASS_CANDIDATE / OWNER REVIEW
- Reason: Owner requires topic supply and duplicate prevention to be solved before G3.

### Artifacts created

- `docs/TOPIC_OPERATING_SYSTEM.md`
- `topic-ledger/README.md`

- `topic-ledger/daily/TEMPLATE.json`
- `topic-ledger/calendar/2026-09.md`
- `topic-ledger/EVERGREEN_BANK.md`
- `schemas/topic_registry_entry.schema.json`

### Decisions

- Calendar alone is insufficient; Registry is canonical topic memory.
- Topic supply is HOT + EVERGREEN.
- Qualified HOT candidates have scheduling preemption; unqualified trends do not.
- Daily task is recommended as signal radar / shortlist only.
- Automatic publishing and automatic `published` state are forbidden.
- Automation has not been enabled.
- G3 remains blocked pending Owner review.

## G3R Final PASS Closeout

Date: 2026-09-20

Owner decision:
**PASS**

Reviewer decision after final consistency review:
**PASS**

Final canonical editorial baseline:
- Bilibili primary;
- daily editorial target;
- production throughput unproven;
- 3–5 min standard target;
- first-person recurring IP;
- STORY_MODEL / STORY_ACTION only;
- tutorial mode removed;
- viewpoint may be story meaning but must be dramatized, bounded, and evidence-grounded.

Final three-case validation:
- Agent v2 — accepted validation — 91/100 self-review;
- Context / Memory v2 — accepted validation — 92/100 self-review;
- MCP v1 — accepted validation — 90/100 self-review.

Final consistency cleanup:
- removed current-state NOT PASS markers from canonical contracts;
- superseded 4–6 / 3–8 duration proposal with 3–5 target;
- superseded STORY_TUTORIAL;
- superseded “观点是余味，不是承重墙” with “观点可以是故事的灵魂，但不能是作者的演讲”;
- rewrote G3R final review;
- rewrote Reviewer Handoff as current authoritative state;
- activated Daily Topic Planner v0.2 by updating the existing scheduled task in place;
- did not start G4.

Gate result:
```text
G3R = PASS
G4 = READY_NOT_STARTED
OWNER_HOLD_BEFORE_G4 = YES
```

## G4 Start — Two-phase Director / Shot Compiler + Agent G4A

Date: 2026-09-20

Owner explicitly authorized entering the next round.

New G4 contract:
- `docs/G4_DIRECTOR_COMPILER_CONTRACT.md`

New intermediate schema:
- `schemas/semantic_shot.schema.json`

Architecture correction:
- G4A locks semantic shot decisions without final timestamps.
- G4B compiles exact start/end/duration only after final audio/SRT is locked.
- This prevents fake precision while preserving the existing final `shot.schema.json` contract.

Agent G4A:
- source script: `episodes/20260920-agent/G3R_narrative_test_v2.md`
- plan: `episodes/20260920-agent/G4A_semantic_shot_plan_v1.json`
- review: `episodes/20260920-agent/G4A_semantic_shot_review_v1.md`
- semantic shots: 36
- result: PASS_CANDIDATE

G4 overall:
`IN_PROGRESS`

G4B:
`BLOCKED_BY_AUDIO_MASTER / AUDIO_MODE=TBD`

No G5 or Antigravity execution started.

---

## G4 Final PASS — Director / VisualBeat Shotbook

Date: 2026-09-20

Final review:
- `docs/G4_VALIDATION_REVIEW.md`

Timing source approved by Owner:
- `JINGSUI_CALIBRATED_REFERENCE`

Evidence:
- Agent: 36 semantic shots / 61 visual beats / 150.14s / avg 2.46s
- Context / Memory: 43 / 63 / 172.19s / avg 2.73s
- MCP: 44 / 63 / 166.38s / avg 2.64s

Machine validation:
- all semantic plans PASS structure checks;
- all visual-beat plans PASS timing continuity checks;
- no overlaps or nonpositive durations.

Gate:
`G4 = PASS`

Next:
`G5 = READY_NOT_STARTED`

Owner explicitly requested pause after G4 PASS. No G5 work started.

## G5 VB009 POV / Execution Compatibility Patch

Date: 2026-09-21

Trigger:
accepted POV audit changed VB009 from OBSERVER to IP_POV_HANDS.

Detected contradiction:
- VB008 source frame is OBSERVER / MEDIUM_CLOSE;
- VB009 target is IP_POV_HANDS / MEDIUM_INSERT;
- old execution row required both a POV reframe and preservation of source camera/crop.

Reviewer decision:
`RETURN_DERIVE_SOURCE_INCOMPATIBLE`.

Correction:
- VB009 `DERIVE_EDIT → GENERATE`;
- remove `source_frame_ref=SRCH_VB008.png`;
- retain VB008 only as semantic/world continuity;
- prompt locks downward first-person desk insert, own adult hand + wine-red/cream cuff + pen + cost sheet;
- exact Chinese remains POST_OVERLAY;
- identity QA is visibility-scoped.

Execution distribution:
- GENERATE: 15
- DERIVE_EDIT: 25
- COMPOSITE_CROP: 4

Result:
`VB009_RETRY_READY_FRESH_GENERATE_IP_POV_HANDS`.

Next:
`Generate/QA VB009 → PASS → VB012`.


---

## G5 Pilot — VB012 PASS_WITH_MINOR

Date: 2026-09-21

Result:
`SRCH_VB012 = PASS_WITH_MINOR`.

Accepted:
- IP_POV policy-page discovery works;
- viewer can tell the page is a refund-rules page;
- later “platform service fee non-refundable” reversal is not leaked;
- page remains readable enough for the Pilot.

Deferred minor issues:
- laptop/desk outer framing remains more visible than ideal;
- generated page included invented “示例平台” branding;
- production package should prefer direct page-view framing and brand NONE;
- exact Chinese remains POST_OVERLAY policy.

Decision:
do not rework VB012 during Pilot.
Continue to VB015.


---

## G5 Pilot — VB015 preflight correction

Date: 2026-09-21

Preflight found stale references inside the VB015 Blueprint:
- background anchor incorrectly said `answer-pane shell`;
- story prop incorrectly referenced `UI_AI_ANSWER_001`.

Both conflict with the actual locked policy-page sequence and were corrected to `UI_POLICY_PAGE_001`.

Execution interpretation:
- full-episode canonical VB015 remains `DERIVE_EDIT(source=VB014)`, because it is a same-page reading-focus shift;
- isolated Pilot does not include VB014, so Pilot validation may generate VB015 as a fresh matched-setup master;
- VB016 must preserve VB015 crop/page geometry and reveal only the previously withheld line.

No architecture change required.


---

## G5 Pilot — VB015 Attempt 1 RETURN_GENERATION_ONLY

Date: 2026-09-21

Result:
`SRCH_VB015 = RETURN_GENERATION_ONLY`.

What failed:
- output expanded into a full help-center page;
- sidebar/modules created excessive density;
- the intended reading movement from previous line to next-line region was not visually dominant;
- setup/reveal anticipation was weak.

What did NOT fail:
- G4 meaning;
- matched setup/reveal architecture;
- DERIVE_EDIT logic for full-episode production.

Retry constraint:
- tight crop only;
- previous policy-line tail may remain visible;
- next-line target region must be centered but blank/blurred/unreadable;
- no sidebar, brand, full-page context, warning icon, arrows, or red/green polarity;
- preserve exact crop/page geometry for VB016 reveal.

Decision:
no architecture rewrite; regenerate only.


---

## G5 Pilot — VB015 PASS_WITH_MINOR

Date: 2026-09-21

Selected:
`VB015 image 1`.

Result:
`SRCH_VB015 = PASS_WITH_MINOR`.

Accepted:
- matched-setup function is clear;
- next-line region is the visual target;
- reversal sentence remains withheld;
- geometry is suitable to lock for VB016.

Deferred minor:
- crop could still be tighter;
- “服务费” label appears earlier than ideal, but does not reveal the actual reversal sentence.

Decision:
do not rework.
Use image 1 as VB016 matched-reveal source geometry.


---

## G5 Pilot — VB016 PASS_WITH_MINOR

Date: 2026-09-21

Result:
`SRCH_VB016 = PASS_WITH_MINOR`.

Accepted:
- matched reveal relationship with VB015 is legible;
- `平台服务费不予退还` becomes the dominant reversal;
- no new character/story layer is introduced.

Deferred minor:
- browser chrome/title remain broader than ideal;
- blue highlight has mild product-demo semantics;
- tighter crop could increase drama but is not required for Pilot.

Decision:
do not rework.
Continue to VB022.


---

## G5 Pilot — VB022 preflight scope

Date: 2026-09-21

Architecture review:
- `COMPOSITE_CROP` is still the correct production mode;
- the dramatic unit is not “AI vs policy” generically;
- it is the object mismatch:
  - question object = `服务费`;
  - evidence object = `订单款项`.

Pilot limitation:
- `UI_AI_ANSWER_001` and `UI_POLICY_PAGE_001` binaries are still not persisted in repo;
- therefore this Pilot first validates visual/semantic comparison grammar with representative crops;
- deterministic full-source composite execution remains pending asset persistence.

Pass condition:
viewer should understand the mismatch without VS / arrows / explanatory card.


---

## G5 Pilot — VB022 Attempt 1 RETURN

Date: 2026-09-21

Result:
`SRCH_VB022 = RETURN_SEMANTIC_EXECUTION_DRIFT`.

Primary semantic failure:
- intended mismatch = question object `服务费` vs evidence object `订单款项`;
- generated output instead contrasted the user question with the later correct conclusion `平台服务费不予退还`;
- this destroys the intended “答非所问 / object mismatch” mechanism.

Execution-contract failure:
- Blueprint/row explicitly prohibit `character`, but output introduced the recurring IP plus a thought bubble and explanatory labels;
- this converted source-crop comparison into an explanation card/comic panel.

Character evidence:
- introduced character also drifted toward juvenile/cute rendering and non-canonical identity/costume semantics;
- because VB022 requires no character at all, the correct fix is removal, not further character prompting.

Retry:
- left crop = `服务费退不退` / service-fee question object;
- right crop = `订单款项将退回原支付方式` / order-funds evidence object;
- no character, hands, bubble, title, VS, arrows, conclusion card;
- preserve central whitespace and let the semantic mismatch be self-evident.

No architecture rewrite required.


---

## G5 Pilot — VB022 PASS_WITH_MINOR

Date: 2026-09-21

Result:
`SRCH_VB022 = PASS_WITH_MINOR_SEMANTIC_COMPARE`.

Accepted:
- left side clearly asks about `服务费`;
- right-side evidence clearly speaks about `订单款项`;
- mismatch is understandable without VS / arrows / explanatory card;
- no character is required.

Deferred minor:
- generated attempt exposed ChatGPT/OpenAI branding despite brand NONE;
- source crops remain broader than ideal.

Execution limitation:
true deterministic `COMPOSITE_CROP` remains pending until `UI_AI_ANSWER_001` and `UI_POLICY_PAGE_001` binaries are persisted.

Decision:
semantic Pilot passes; continue VB025.


---

## G5 Pilot — VB025 preflight correction

Date: 2026-09-21

Preflight found stale analogy-world references:
- Blueprint background anchor incorrectly said `stable answer-pane shell`;
- Blueprint story props incorrectly included `UI_AI_ANSWER_001`.

Corrected:
- background = minimal phonebook analogy space;
- only causal prop = `PROP_CONTACT_BOOK_001`;
- AI UI / diagram / title / arrows remain prohibited.

Identity scope correction:
- `CHAR_IP_001` remains canonical identity-locked;
- `TEMP_ANALOGY_ACTOR_001` is sequence-local and must be distinct/secondary, not treated as the same canonical identity.

Pilot execution note:
- isolated Pilot does not include VB024 source;
- Pilot may generate a representative payoff frame fresh;
- full-episode canonical mode remains `DERIVE_EDIT(source=VB024)`;
- recurring-IP drift is a high-risk QA item because canonical IP binary is still not persisted.


---

## G5 Pilot — VB025 Attempt 1 RETURN_EXECUTION

Date: 2026-09-21

Result:
`SRCH_VB025 = RETURN_EXECUTION`.

Failures:
- required two-person story payoff disappeared;
- output became a prop/product-demo close-up;
- giant phone UI violated the explicit negative constraint;
- style drifted toward realistic/3D product illustration;
- therefore the analogy did not land as a story moment.

Retry:
- two-shot story scene;
- left: canonical IP puzzled / speechless;
- right: clearly adult supporting actor confidently presenting the correct paper contact-book record;
- only causal prop = paper contact book;
- cue = boss phone number / correct boss record;
- no AI UI, giant phone, title, arrows, explanatory card or bubble;
- simplified flat narrative comic only.

No theory rewrite required.


---

## G5 Pilot — VB025 Attempt 2 RETURN_CHARACTER_DRIFT

Date: 2026-09-21

Result:
`SRCH_VB025 = RETURN_CHARACTER_DRIFT`.

What improved:
- two-person story payoff is now structurally correct;
- supporting actor confidently presents the correct boss contact;
- IP puzzled reaction makes the wrong-facet answer legible;
- paper contact book works as the causal prop.

What failed:
- CHAR_IP_001 became juvenile/chibi again;
- eyes enlarged, face rounded, chin shortened, blush/cute semantics increased;
- costume drifted toward a burgundy hoodie instead of canonical wine-red + cream/off-white collar;
- rendering moved toward cute anime rather than simplified flat narrative comic.

Retry rule:
preserve composition, blocking and prop action.
Correct only recurring-IP identity/costume/style; keep the supporting actor adult and distinct.

No G4/G5 architecture rewrite required.


---

## G5 Pilot — VB025 PASS_WITH_MINOR_CHARACTER_RISK

Date: 2026-09-21

Result:
`SRCH_VB025 = PASS_WITH_MINOR_CHARACTER_RISK`.

Accepted:
- two-person analogy payoff works as a story scene;
- supporting actor confidently presents correct boss contact;
- recurring IP reaction makes the wrong-facet answer legible;
- auxiliary actor remains visually distinct.

Deferred character risk:
- CHAR_IP_001 is less juvenile than prior attempt but still not fully canonical;
- face/hair geometry and costume retain residual drift;
- hoodie-like interpretation risk remains.

Production implication:
canonical IP image reference must be persisted and bound as an actual image input before G6 deterministic generation.
Prompt-only identity lock is insufficient.

Decision:
do not rework VB025 during Pilot.
Continue final high-risk beat VB044.

- VB044 Blueprint story prop = `UI_POLICY_PAGE_001`;
- old asset binding/execution still referenced `UI_AI_ANSWER_001`;
- old mode tried `DERIVE_EDIT(source=VB001)`;
- VB001 contains the opening AI-answer shell, while VB044 needs the correct policy/source page;
- old edit instruction simultaneously required preserving UI shell.

Decision:
`RETURN_DERIVE_SOURCE_INCOMPATIBLE`.

Correction:
- VB044 `DERIVE_EDIT → GENERATE`;
- `source_frame_ref = null`;
- bind `UI_POLICY_PAGE_001`;
- preserve `composition_callback_ref = SRCH_VB001` as spatial/visual rhyme only;
- opening/ending callback is now composition continuity, not source-image derivation.

New mode counts:
- GENERATE: 17
- DERIVE_EDIT: 23
- COMPOSITE_CROP: 4

Next:
generate final high-risk Pilot beat VB044.

## G5 Pilot — VB044 Attempt 1 RETURN_EXECUTION

Date: 2026-09-21

Result:
`SRCH_VB044 = RETURN_EXECUTION`.

Failure:
- callback became a before/after summary poster instead of a story callback;
- protagonist was duplicated into two versions;
- bubbles, arrow, English slogan and checklist were introduced despite explicit suppression;
- the intended action change — actively checking the source — was no longer the dominant event.

What remains valid:
- ending callback architecture;
- observer-view medium-close;
- opening/ending spatial rhyme;
- behavior-change payoff.

Retry:
- one recurring IP only;
- same desk/monitor relationship as opening;
- IP calmly and deliberately clicks/checks the source;
- no second self, split-screen, bubble, arrow, slogan, checklist, moral text, cat or extra props.

No architecture rewrite required.

## G5 Pilot — VB044 Attempt 2 RETURN_EXECUTION

Date: 2026-09-21

Result:
`SRCH_VB044 = RETURN_EXECUTION_ATTEMPT2`.

Improved:
- one recurring IP only;
- opening-like character/monitor composition is much closer;
- character maturity is acceptable for Pilot;
- hand/trackpad action begins to read as deliberate verification.

Remaining failures:
- screen shows OpenAI homepage rather than the causal policy/source page;
- OpenAI branding violates `brand_mode = NONE`;
- notebook reintroduces checklist/lesson-card semantics;
- therefore the frame still explains the lesson instead of showing one verification behavior.

Retry rule:
preserve current character, camera, desk and verification gesture.
Edit only:
1. screen → generic brandless policy/source page;
2. remove checklist/moral text from foreground notebook.

## G5 High-Risk Pilot Final Closure

Date: 2026-09-21

Final accepted Pilot states:
- VB001 PASS_WITH_MINOR
- VB009 PASS_WITH_MINOR
- VB012 PASS_WITH_MINOR
- VB015 PASS_WITH_MINOR
- VB016 PASS_WITH_MINOR
- VB022 PASS_WITH_MINOR_SEMANTIC_COMPARE
- VB025 PASS_WITH_MINOR_CHARACTER_RISK
- VB044 PASS_WITH_MINOR

Result:
`HIGH_RISK_PILOT = PASS_CANDIDATE`.

Gate:
`G5 = PASS_CANDIDATE_BLOCKED_BY_REAL_REFERENCE_PERSISTENCE`.

The remaining blocker is not story/frame theory. It is executable canonical reference persistence and binding.

## 2026-09-23 — G6R Candidate Runtime Reconciliation

Reviewer takeover identified a post-extraction runtime seam between current Candidate timing and legacy G4 Visual Beat absolute timing.

Reconciliation evidence:

- project and Skill branches started from current main with no behind commits;
- 44 Speech Units ↔ 44 accepted Visual Beats: exact ID-set match;
- missing bindings: 0;
- duplicate bindings: 0;
- planned total preserved: 146.7209s;
- Candidate Visual Beat schema now requires `speech_unit_id`, `start_anchor`, `end_anchor`, `timing_flex`;
- legacy `JINGSUI_PRIOR_ESTIMATE` absolute timing removed from current Candidate Visual Beat output;
- deterministic resolver reference added at `entropy-student/spike.skill/story-showrunner/runtime/timeline_resolver.py`;
- resolver reference syntax was Reviewer-checked;
- synthetic duration-mutation smoke:
  - Visual Beats resolved: 44;
  - overlap count: 0;
  - synthetic final duration: 147.247618s;
  - text changed: false;
  - Beat order changed: false;
  - POV changed: false;
  - profile drift flags remained diagnostic;
- Candidate-compliant `production-package-v2` created;
- Skill PR #2 merged at `7114f9f85c645cd72cda67bb7db865d22272b2ae`;
- Project PR #4 merged at `5b927e5cb5464cf94e250d58b2c00f2498a9152e`.

Reviewer decision:

`PASS_G6R_CANDIDATE_RUNTIME_RECONCILIATION`

Release:

`G6A_FIRST_E2E_ASSET_CALIBRATION = READY_NOT_EXECUTED`

Remaining unproven facts:
- real 43-unit CosyVoice production TTS;
- real Runtime Timeline Resolver execution against those durations;
- 44 production frames under package v2;
- final FFmpeg video E2E.

## Gate G6A — Real audio execution / listening QA return

- Date: 2026-09-23
- Scope: first real production TTS + runtime timeline execution inside the G6A asset-calibration run.
- Gate status after review: `IN_PROGRESS / RETURN_AUDIO_LISTENING_QUALITY`.

### Verified execution facts

- 44 semantic/timeline units.
- 43 voiced CosyVoice units + 1 silent reaction unit.
- Runtime Timeline Resolver executed against real normalized durations.
- Final runtime artifacts were produced:
  - `FINAL_SUBTITLES.srt`
  - `FINAL_TIMELINE.json`
  - `FINAL_SHOT_TIMELINE.csv`
  - `TIMELINE_RESOLUTION_REPORT.json`
- Narration master duration: approximately 143.0936s.
- First production-frame snapshot: 20 / 44 generated.

### Owner listening evidence

RETURN items were reported around:
- 13s, 16s, 18s, 47s, 51s: hard joins / missing breathing gaps;
- 18s: abrupt interruption;
- 55s: pause too long;
- 58s: articulation unclear / tail-cut risk;
- 68s: phrase mispronunciation;
- ~1:23: numeric pronunciation wrong;
- ~2:02: AI pronunciation wrong;
- ~2:08: syllables crowded / overlapped.

Qualitative voice evidence:
- insufficiently human;
- noisy / synthetic voiced texture;
- weak emotional variation.

### Reviewer disposition

- structural runtime-timeline architecture remains valid;
- final audio is **not accepted**;
- targeted CosyVoice repair is preferred over full regeneration for known local defects;
- GPT-SoVITS may be evaluated as a candidate replacement, but no provider promotion is allowed without A/B PASS;
- final video render remains blocked.

## G6A — GPT-SoVITS local environment / WebUI closeout

Date: 2026-09-23

Owner-local environment report confirms:
- `C:\AI\GPT-SoVITS` exists;
- dedicated Python `C:\Users\34707\miniconda3\envs\GPTSoVits\python.exe`;
- Python 3.10.21;
- user-site disabled;
- CUDA available on RTX 4050 Laptop GPU;
- Gradio/FastAPI/Starlette and required runtime imports PASS;
- project config PASS, port 9874, device `cuda:0`;
- `zh_CN` locale PASS;
- Owner subsequently confirmed the WebUI opened successfully.

Non-blocking note:
`pip check` reports a `faster-whisper → onnxruntime` distribution-name mismatch while the installed `onnxruntime-gpu` module imports successfully.

Reviewer interpretation:
`GPT_SOVITS_LOCAL_WEBUI = PASS_FOR_A_B_TRIAL`.

This is not an audio-quality PASS and does not replace CosyVoice yet.

## G6A — GPT-SoVITS fine-tune and representative listening QA evidence

Date: 2026-09-23

Observed evidence:
- formal SoVITS candidate: `narrator01_v2pp_e8_s248.pth`;
- formal GPT checkpoints tested: e5 / e10 / e15;
- e15 produced an abnormal / near-empty synthesis in the current QA path;
- e10 produced at least one acceptable result but repeated QA also produced duplicated speech and sparse/non-speech failures; temperature 0.8 did not make it sufficiently reliable;
- e5 + e8 produced 3/3 successful repeated stability generations;
- curiosity/suspicion repeated QA with e5 produced 3/3 successful generations with target timbre accepted by Owner;
- same-text WebUI cache/freeze replay produced 3 perceptually identical outputs;
- reversal/surprise and serious-closing probes were accepted by Owner;
- a short-reaction probe with a leading ellipsis failed; removing the leading ellipsis succeeded;
- ordinary comma produced a slightly long pause; removing the comma removed the pause; enumeration comma failed in that probe;
- Owner selected ordinary Chinese comma as default and rejected systematic pause-insertion post-processing due engineering overhead.

Reviewer interpretation:
`GPT_SOVITS_MANUAL_LISTENING_QA = PASS_CANDIDATE`.

Not yet proven:
- official API determinism;
- production adapter behavior;
- GPT-SoVITS Voice Timing Profile safety;
- full-episode replacement;
- final-video E2E.

Prepared-but-not-yet-executed API helpers:
- `tools/gpt-sovits/PATCH_API_TORCHCODEC.bat`;
- `tools/gpt-sovits/START_GPT_SOVITS_API.bat`;
- `tools/gpt-sovits/RUN_API_DETERMINISM_SMOKE.bat`;
- `tools/gpt-sovits/API_DETERMINISM_SMOKE.py`.

Next required evidence:
official API smoke + retained WAV/report + listening acceptance, then one-time GPT-SoVITS timing calibration with held-out validation.

## G6A — Owner listening acceptance and asset-stage timing disposition

Date: 2026-09-23

Owner listening result for the GPT-SoVITS API sample:
- voice quality: acceptable;
- known issue: some generated phrases still contain overly long internal pauses / breath gaps.

Disposition:
- do not reject otherwise usable material solely because its duration misses the planned target;
- do not force exact target duration during asset generation;
- measure and record actual generated duration precisely for every Speech Unit;
- use that measured timing as SRT2/runtime material truth;
- defer routine redundant-breath cleanup until the post-assembly SRT3 pass.

This listening acceptance does not by itself promote GPT-SoVITS to canonical and does not replace the requirement to persist the local API smoke evidence into the project repository.
